    "# GAN Introduction \n",
    "GANs are comprised of both generator and discriminator models. The generator is responsible for generating new samples from the domain, and the discriminator is responsible for classifying whether samples are real or fake (generated). Importantly, the performance of the discriminator model is used to update both the model weights of the discriminator itself and the generator model. This means that the generator never actually sees examples from the domain and is adapted based on how well the discriminator performs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a complex type of model both to understand and to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach to better understand the nature of GAN models and how they can be trained is to develop a model from scratch for a very simple task.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple task that provides a good context for developing a simple GAN from scratch is a one-dimensional function. This is because both real and generated samples can be plotted and visually inspected to get an idea of what has been learned. A simple function also does not require sophisticated neural network models, meaning the specific generator and discriminator models used on the architecture can be easily understood.\n",
